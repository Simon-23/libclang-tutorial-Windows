# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: LibClang tutorial

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # Run on Windows instead of Ubuntu
    runs-on: windows-latest
    
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
